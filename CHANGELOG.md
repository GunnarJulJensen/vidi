# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [CalVer](https://calver.org/).

## [UNRELEASED]
### Added
- The awesome Leaflet plugin Leaflet.markercluster is added, so by setting the meta property `use_clustering` to `true` clustering can be enabled on single point vector layers. No other setting for Leaflet.markercluster is available for now.
- With the `cssFiles` config it's possible to load external css file from the `configUrl`. E.g.:
```json
{
  "cssFiles": [
       "myStyles1.css",
       "myStyles2.css"
  ]
}
```
- Conflict is now using `sqlQuery.js` to show info-click result. So now are multiple results possible. The `sqlQuery.js` module now has a Simple mode, a prefix for DOM elements to render in and callback for when selecting a row.
- New config setting `dontUseAdvancedBaseLayerSwitcher` which will disable the 'Display two layers at once' option in the base layer switcher.
- New GC2 Meta properties `select_function` which adds an onSelect callback to the result list in click-for-info.
- It now possible to render an image carousel in popups from a click-for-info. Create a JSON field with a value like this and set Content to Image:
```json
[
  {
    "src": "https://image1.jpeg",
    "att": "It's an image!"
  },
  {
    "src": "https://image1.jpeg",
    "att": "It's another image!!"
  }
]
```
- URL's can now be ignored for caching in Service Worker by using the `urlsIgnoredForCaching` setting in `config/config.js`. This setting can only be set in build time. E.g.:
```json
{
    "urlsIgnoredForCaching": [
        {
            "regExp": true,
            "requested": "part_of_the_url"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Changed
- `public\js\vidi.js`is now required instead of loaded in a script tag. This way it's transpiled and can contain new JavaScript syntax.
- A lot of improvements in the `conflictSearch` module:
    - Results are now alpha sorted within layers groups (which is also sorted). Both in web and PDF.
    - A short and long description can be added for each layer, which is shown the result list. Use GC2 Meta properties: `short_conflict_meta_desc and `long_conflict_meta_desc`. 
    - The styling of both web and PDF results is better. Tables can't overflow the PDF page.
    - Ellipsis is used both in web and PDF when fields names / results are too long.
    - Empty link fields will now just be blank.
    - Layers with only one report column will be printed as a `|` separated string and not a table with one column.
    - New button for setting the print extent before creating a PDF.
    - Mouse click when releasing a rectangle/circle drag is suppressed.
    - Multiple results from a Select-Object-To-Search-With is now possible. The standard `sqlQuery` is used to create list. 
    
- Indicator in layer tree showing if a tile layer (MapServer or QGIS Server) is visible in the view extent. The Leaflet layer canvas element is being checked for colored pixels. Be aware of the canvas being bigger than the view extent because of the buffer. A event is triggered when a layer changes visibility called `tileLayerVisibility:layers` with a payload like this:
```json
{
    "id": "schema.layer.geom",
    "dataIsVisible": true
}
```
- Handlebars are now use instead of Mustache for rendering click-for-info templates. Handlebars is more feature rich than Mustache.
- The load screen is now being dismissed on `ready:meta` instead of `allDoneLoading:layers`. This makes the application interactive sooner. 
- Predefined filters are now processes as one string. Instead of sending something like this `["foo=1","foo=2"]` to GC2, it is now `["(foo=1 OR foo=2)"]`. This is how arbitrary filters work and both kind of filters are now being processed together like `["(foo=1 OR foo=2)", "(bar=1 OR bar=2)"]`. The GC2 backend can then set the operator between the predefined and arbitrary filters. 

### Fixed
- Using `indexOf` instead of `includes`, because the latter is not transpiled in Babel. It's an Internet Explorer issue.
- `embed.js` now works in IE11.

## [2020.2.0]
### Added
- Custom user data from GC2 is now added to session the object.
- Handling of invalid JSON configs.

### Changed
- CalVer is now used with month identifier like this: YYYY.MM.Minor.Modifier
- Custom searches can now be added to danish search module.
- `embed.js` will wait with loading Vidi until target element is visible in the DOM. This way, Vidi can be embedded in a element with `display:none`.
- Its now possible to add custom extra searches to `danish.js`. A search needs an Elasticsearch index, which must have an id and string property. The latter is the search string. Also a look-up table/view with geometries is required. An example of a setup:
```javascript
{
    searchConfig: {
        size: 4,
        komkode: "*",
        esrSearchActive: true,
        sfeSearchActive: true, // Example of config for danish search
        extraSearches: [,{
            name: "stednavne_search",
            db: "dk",
            host: "https://dk.gc2.io",
            heading: "Stednavne",
            index: {
                name: "stednavne/navne_samlet",
                field: "string",
                key: "gid",

            },
            relation: {
                name: "stednavne.navne_samlet_geom",
                key: "gid",
                geom: "the_geom"
            }
        }]
    }
}
``` 
- New GC2 Meta properties which controls the info pop-up and styling of vector layers:
    - *info_template*: Mustache template for use in pop-up.
    - *info_element_selector*: Which element to render info template in? Defaults to pop-up.
    - *info_function*: Function which is run when clicking on a vector feature. Takes five args: feature (Leaflet), layer (Leaflet), layer key (Vidi), SQL store (Vidi) and map (Leaflet).
    - *point_to_layer*: Leaflet pointToLayer function.
    - *vector_style*: Leaflet vector styling function.
    
- The help buttons now work like toggles, so a second click will close the help box.
    
### Fixed
- Handling of invalid JSON configs, so Node doesn't crash.


## [2019.1.0] - 2019-20-12
### Added
- Implemented a generic pool for puppeteer processes, so there is always a warm chromium browser ready for print.
- Node clustering implemented with default count of workers, which is the cpu core count.
- Sticky sessions implemented so Socket.io works with clustering.
- Redis added as storage for sessions. Just set `redisHost` in `config/config.js`. If not set then file storage will be used.

### Changed
- A lot of optimization of Javascript code. Code that can is lazy loaded.
- The server is now using gzip compression.
- Meets the requirements for a Progressive Web App (PWA) according to Google Lighthouse.

### Fixed
- The startup message set by `startUpModal` is ever shown in print.
- Images in pop-ups will now open in new tab when using Chrome.  

## [2019.1.0.rc3] - 2019-06-11
### Added
- Embed script for easy embedding of Vidi in web pages using a snap-shot token.
- A corresponding UTFGrid layer is now switch on when a raster tile layer is switch on. The UTFGrid layer is providing mouse over on features. Which fields are displayed in mouse over is set in GC2 field properties.
- Download drawings as GeoJSON.
- Comment with version in index.html
- Support of time, date and datetime fields in editor. Only time will be handled in a text field.
- Auto login. WARNING: Insecure and sets cookie with login creds. A build time setting `autoLoginPossible` must be set to `true` to make activation possible. Activation is done in:
    - `extensionConfig.session.autoLogin = true` and optional `extensionConfig.session.autoLoginMaxAge = 3600 * 1000`. The latter defaults to `null`
- Static Map API. Generate PNGs of state snapshot. URL to PNG is available from the Snapshot module.
- Possible to set a welcome message by using `startUpModal` in a config. The user can dismiss the message by either `Close` or `Close and do not show in future`. The latter choise is stored in a cookie.

### Changed
- Layers which have been switch off, will not be removed from legend (old behavior can be set in config)
- No re-load of legend if its not necessary.
- `embed.tmpl` is now a minimal template for embedding in web pages.
- Home button on `embed.tmpl` will set the map to the initial extent if a snapshot-state is invoked.
- Use file based sessions instead of memory based, so sessions can be shared between nodes in a cluster setup.
- Standard template for pop-up can now render videos from URLs in data. Can be set up in GC2.
- Infinity levels in layer tree. The levels are set with the `vidi_sub_group` Meta property in GC2 like: `sub-group 1|sub-group 2|sub-group 3`
- Smaller padding of dynamic loaded vector layers, so less features has to be handled. Padding is set to 0.3 from 1.

### Fixed
- Better wrapping of layer tools when side panel is narrow.
- Snapping bugs.
- SELECT statements like `SELECT * FROM foo WHERE bar LIKE '%foo'` will not longer give problems.
- All Postgres types are now recognized in editor. 

## [2019.1.0.rc2] - 2019-01-03
### Added
- Tentative support of WebGL layer type added.
- Support of MVT base layers.

### Changed
- Optimized rendering of layer tree. Implemented lazy rendering of layer groups and tools. 
- Hide login button if session module is disabled.

## [2019.1.0.rc1] - 2019-14-02
### Added
- Fall back mechanism for base layers. If the current base layer responses with error codes the next one is switched no.
- Touch drag enabled in layer tree.
- Config `activateMainTab` added, which tells Vidi to activate a tab on startup.
- Visual grouping of map tools in GUI.
- Tentative support of Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT). Needs latest version of GC2 with MVT support. 
- Cross hair cursor when info click is on.
- When drawing or editing with the Editor module, snapping to other vector layers is added.
- Unify filter methods for vector and tile layers.
- After a query with the sqlQuery module is made, its now possible to store the query as a new "virtual" layer. The new layer is a vector layer, which acts like any other vector layer.

### Changed
- State shots are now stored in GC2 database using the new keyvalue API.
- Protected WMS layers requests result in `401` being routed through the WMS backend. A authentication is implemented in order to request protected WMS layers correctly.
- One click activation scheme where the module is activated when clicking the Tab. All others modules will be reset. A typical module should look like this:
- Google API files are no longer requested locally, because things break when Google makes updates. The files are requested remotely and are not cached in Service Workers due to CORS issues. The Google API doesn't work offline anyway. Google API must be set in GC2 config (App.php) with the kay ``
```javascript
module.exports = {
   set: function (o) {},
   init: function () {
     // Reset state and clear any effects of the module
     backboneEvents.get().on("reset:all", () => {});
 
     // Stop listening to any events, deactivate controls, but
     // keep effects of the module until they are deleted manually or reset:all is emitted
     backboneEvents.get().on("deactivate:all", () => {});
 
     // Activates module
     backboneEvents.get().on("on:myModule", () => {});
 
     // Deactivates module
     backboneEvents.get().on("off:myModule", () => {});
   }
 }
 ```

## [2018.2.0.rc1] - 2018-07-12
### Added
- New mode for double base-layers: Overlay base-layers, where the opacity of the top one can be changed
- Filters for WMS single tile layers. Predefine filters in GC2 Meta, which will be displayed as checkboxes in a layertree panel. For now only supports QGIS layers.

### Changed
- Vector filters can now be applied before switching a vector layer on.
- Table view are moved inside the layer tree, which makes it possible to see more than one table at a time.
- Table view clicks now pan to feature - not zooming.
- Popups for raster and vectors are now similar.

### Fixed
- When clicking in a table with points, panning now works.
- Workaround missing Service Workers features in Edge 17/18.
- Filters work in Edge 17/18.
- A lot of smaller issues were fixed.

## [2018.1] - 2018-07-12
### Added
- Specific vector layers can be set to offline. If offline the cached version of the vector layer is always used. Also if browser is reloaded.
- Control to switch all vector layers on and off. See above.
- Vector layers can now be set to two different load strategies: Static and Dynamic. The former is default and will load the entire layer at once. The latter will load only whats inside the view port (plus a buffer) and fetch new data when needed (when zoom/pan occurs). The load strategy is controlled by the GC2 `load_strategy` meta setting. Can be either `s` or `d`.  
- New map controls: Reset zoom, set previous/next extent and box-zoom. The latter now has a button, before this could only be achieved by holding shift down and drag the zoom box. 
- Opacity slider for all tile layers.

### Fixed
- Preset base layer in URL will not longer change to `undefined` when resizing browser during refresh.
- System field with prefix `gc2_` is no longer displayed in Editor attribute form.
- Stalling of print is fixed. 


## [2018.1.0.RC1] - 2018-10-9
### Added
- Drag'n'drop sorting of layers in layer tree. Sorting can be done between layers in a group and groups between groups. Sorting sticks after refresh of browser.
- Third level in layer tree. The third sub-group is set with the `vidi_sub_group` Meta property in GC2.
- Vector layers are now treated equally with tile layers. With the `vidi_layer_type` Meta property set GC2 a layer can be displayed as either tile or vector. Its also possible to switch between tile and vector directly in the layer tree.
- Vector layers can be filtered. An arbitrary number of filter expressions can be applied. 
- Table view of vector layers. See the attributes and link to the geometry on the map.
- Service Workers. Vidi is becoming a Progressive Web App (PWA).
    - Vidi starts without network. And always starts quick.
    - Vector layers are cached, so they can be used without network.
    - A change in source code will generated a new version hash, which will trigger the Service Workers to re-install the application.
    - Offline base layers. Base layers can be partial caches in browser for use without network.
    - Editor. Both tile and vector layers can be edited. Edits can be done without network.
- Side-by-side base layers. Swipe between two base layers.
- Save, restore and share projects. A project comprises the extent of the map, which background map is visible and which layers are turned on, which filters are applied as well as your drawings. You can share a project by sharing a URL. If you are not logged in, projects will be linked to the browser you are using. Otherwise, they will be stored under your user login. It is possible to transfer projects from browser to login.  
- New Kepler.gl module. Select layers in Vidi and start Kepler.gl with them. Kepler.gl is embedded in Vidi.
- Proper implementation of non-tiled layers, which is well suited for layer with live data and heat- and cluster maps. 

### Changed
- New user interface layout in default template. Where are now more space for the module dialogs.
- Leaflet.js updated to newest.
- Print now uses Puppeteer instead of Wkhtmltopdf. Puppeteer can be installed and updated with npm as any other module and its easier to debug.
- Is fully supported only in browsers with Service Workers.

### Deprecated

### Removed
- Layers Search module. This function is now moved to the contrib module vidiSearch.

### Fixed
- Calculation of area on drawing module now works.

### Security
- A lot of modules where updated.
